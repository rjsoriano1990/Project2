# Covid-19: Unemployment, Vaccines, and Deaths

## Project Proposal

Our team wanted to look at the effects of Covid-19. We looked for datasets on unemployment, vaccines, and deaths all by state.
We wanted to see if life has gotten better over time with people getting vaccinated, be it lower death percentage or lower unemployment rates.

## Data

Data accumulated from: 
- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
- The Bureau of Labor Statistics
Data population consists of **Unemployment Rates** taken from The Bureau of Labor Statistics, **Covid-19 Vaccinations** and **Deaths Related to Covid-19** taken from The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
